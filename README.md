# Advent of Code
This is a mega-repository containing my personal solutions to the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenge, written in C++17. The code written for these challenges is not meant to be optimal C++ code. It is probably not efficient, probably not the shortest solution, probably not the cleanest solution, and probably written differently from how you would have solved this issue, and that's okay! I'm doing my best to learn as much as I can and I don't reasonably expect anybody to use this code in any sort of production environment. If you're here, you've probably either stumbled upon it randomly or were sent it and was curious how I solved one of the challenges.

# Project Structure
At the root of this repository you'll find directories for each year of Advent of Code that I've completed. Within those directories will be individual projects for each day located under `DayX` (where `X` is the numerical day). The root of this project contains a VisualStudio solution which should open the appropriate projects and configure them accordingly. Additionally, there is a `AdventOfCodeLibrary` project, a static library, in the root which contains common functions used between each day.
